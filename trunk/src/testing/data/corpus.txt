Institutional repositories-used in this paper to mean digital collections capturing and preserving the intellectual output of a single or multi-university community-provide a compelling response to two strategic issues facing academic institutions. Such repositories:

Provide a critical component in reforming the system of scholarly communication-a component that expands access to research, reasserts control over scholarship by the academy, increases competition and reduces the monopoly power of journals, and brings economic relief and heightened relevance to the institutions and libraries that support them; and
Have the potential to serve as tangible indicators of a university's quality and to demonstrate the scientific, societal, and economic relevance of its research activities, thus increasing the institution's visibility, status, and public value.
Institutional repositories can provide an immediate and valuable complement to the existing scholarly publishing model, while stimulating innovation in a new disaggregated publishing structure that will evolve and improve over time. Further, they build on a growing grassroots faculty practice of self-posting research online. While institutional repositories necessitate that libraries-as their logical administrative proponents-facilitate development of university intellectual property policies, encourage faculty authors to retain the right to self-archive, and broaden both faculty and administration perspectives on these issues, they can be implemented without radically altering the status quo. Moreover, they can be introduced by reallocating existing resources, usually without extensive technical development.

In sum, institutional repositories offer a strategic response to systemic problems in the existing scholarly journal system-and the response can be applied immediately, reaping both short-term and ongoing benefits for universities and their faculty and advancing the positive transformation of scholarly communication over the long term.

This paper examines institutional repositories strategically, from two complementary perspectives: 1) as a natural extension of academic institutions' responsibility as generators of primary research seeking to preserve and leverage their constituents' intellectual assets; and 2) as one potentially major component in the evolving structure of scholarly communication. We describe the roles of institutional repositories in this structure and explore the impact on major stakeholders in the process and outcomes.
